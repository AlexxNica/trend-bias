The overlaid green trend line represents a robust fit (ignoring the outlier values), while the overlaid orange line represents the standard OLS fit with all points included. The purple line represents the average participant response on this stimulus. In general, participants' estimates of trend lines were closer to the robust than the non-robust trend; regression by eye tends to downweight outliers compared to OLS.}

Larger bandwidths mean more dispersion and so weaker fits.}

Area charts are visually asymmetric, with the area below the line filled in with a color. This visual asymmetry results in a form of within-the-bar bias\protect\cite{newman2012bar}, where values in the filled region are perceived as likelier than values outside of it. This bias manifests as a consistent underestimation in the intercept of trend lines. Other chart types we examined do not have this bias.

As the number of outliers increases, there is increasing divergence between the robust line of best fit (which ignores outliers), and the standard OLS line of best fit (which is sensitive to outliers). Estimates become increasingly dissimilar to the OLS fit, indicating that participants downweight of outliers when making estimates of trend. However, the increasing error even from the robust trend line indicates that participants still perform some interpolation between the two types of fits. Confidence intervals represent bootstrapped 95\% c.i.s of interquartile mean. }
