In general, participants' estimates of trend lines were closer to the robust than the non-robust trend; regression by eye tends to down-weight outliers compared to OLS.}

Larger bandwidths mean more dispersion and so weaker fits.}

Area charts are visually asymmetric, with the area below the line filled in with a color. This visual asymmetry results in a form of within-the-bar bias~\protect\cite{newman2012bar}, where values in the filled region are perceived as likelier than values outside of it. This bias manifests as a consistent under-estimation in the intercept of trend lines. Other chart types we examined do not have this bias.

As the number of outliers increases, there is increasing divergence between the robust line of best fit (which ignores outliers), and the standard OLS line of best fit (which is sensitive to outliers). Estimates become increasingly dissimilar to the OLS fit, indicating that participants down-weight outliers when making estimates of trend. However, the increasing error even from the robust trend line indicates that participants still perform some interpolation between the two types of fits. Confidence intervals represent bootstrapped 95\% CIs of interquartile means. }

Participants were significantly closer to the robust fit, indicating that they were largely insensitive to outliers. We also include the absolute error for trials with no outliers for reference. Error to the robust line is higher than this standard, indicating that participants were at least performing some interpolation between OLS and robust fits, even if they largely favored the robust fit.
