In addition to minor changes to the paper, we have made the following more substantial changes, as per the reviewer comments:

1) As part of the de-anonymizing process, we added a link to a  public repository containing study materials and data tables.

2) We justified and clarified our use of interquartile means in our statistical analyses.

3) We justified our study instruments, contrasting our methods with ongoing work in free-form drawing and solicitations in information visualization.

4) We restructured the methods section to make certain information (e.g. exclusions, and participant information) clearer, and easier to interpret.

5) We included an “implications for design” subsection, explicitly enumerating how designers might make use of the conclusions we draw in our experiment.
